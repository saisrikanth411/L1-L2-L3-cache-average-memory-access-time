Computer Architecture-2 Assignment 01
Memory Hierarchy and access time

Instructions to execute and obtain the access for linear read, linear write , random read and random write memory access patterns

The given folder contains source files,Makefile and report
To obtain the access times for the following access patterns-

1)Linear read
i)Open the terminal and type 'make all' and get the executable from the Makefile
ii)Type'./linearread' in the terminal to execute the linear read access pattern
iii)Type the size of cache required to obtain access time of in multiples of 1024 as the smallest size that can fit in is 1kB.
iv)The time is obtained for each size from the size specified to the lowest size.
v)Type './linearread > linearread.txt' to transfer the output to a text file.
vi) Use Matlab or LibreOffice to plot the access time graph from the data obtained

2)Linear write
i)Open the terminal and type 'make all' and get the executable from the Makefile
ii)Type'./mountain' in the terminal to execute the linear read access pattern
iii)Type the size of cache required to obtain access time of in multiples of 1024 as the smallest size that can fit in is 1kB.
iv)The time is obtained for each size from the size specified to the lowest size.
v)Type './mountain > mountain.txt' to transfer the output to a text file.
vi) Use Matlab or LibreOffice to plot the access time graph from the data obtained.

3)Random read
i)Open the terminal and type 'make all' and get the executable from the Makefile
ii)Type'./randomread' in the terminal to execute the linear read access pattern
iii)Type the size of cache required to obtain access time of in multiples of 1024 as the smallest size that can fit in is 1kB.
iv)The time is obtained for each size.
v)Run the program multiple times using different cache sizes.
v)Type './randomread > randomread.txt' to transfer the output to a text file for each cache size.
vi) Use Matlab or LibreOffice to plot the access time graph from the data obtained

3)Random write
i)Open the terminal and type 'make all' and get the executable from the Makefile
ii)Type'./random' in the terminal to execute the linear read access pattern
iii)Type the size of cache required to obtain access time of in multiples of 1024 as the smallest size that can fit in is 1kB.
iv)The time is obtained for each size.
v)Run the program multiple times using different cache sizes.
v)Type './randomr > random.txt' to transfer the output to a text file for each cache size.
vi) Use Matlab or LibreOffice to plot the access time graph from the data obtained

GEM5 Instructions
1)Install the Gem5 package and all other dependencies required to run Gem5.
2)Type '/build/X86/gem5.opt --outdir=tests configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=DerivO3CPU --caches --l1i_size=32kB --l1d_size=64kB --l2cache --l2_size=256kB -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello' to set the Simulator CPU Parameters.
3)Run your program on the gem5 simulator
4)Type 'cd m5out' and open the stats.txt folder.
5)Note down the sim seconds or sim ticks.
6)Run your program by on GEM% commenting out the read or write part of the linear or random program.
7)Open stats.txt and note down the sim seconds and sim ticks again.
8)Find the difference and divide it by the number of iterations to obtain average access time.
